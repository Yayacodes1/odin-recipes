# Odin Recipes

> A bare-bones multi-page recipe website built in the Foundations course of The Odin Project.

## Introduction

**Odin Recipes** is your first project in The Odin Project’s Foundations course. In this exercise, you’ll practice all your HTML fundamentals by building:

- A **main index page** that links to three separate recipe pages  
- Three **individual recipe pages**, each with a title, image, description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions  

By the time you finish this project, you will have demonstrated your ability to:

- **Create semantic HTML** documents with proper boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links  
- **Organize a project folder** (`index.html` + `/recipes/` subfolder with recipe pages)  
- **Use Git & GitHub**: initialize a repo, clone it locally, stage changes, commit with descriptive messages, and push to remote  
- **Build inter-page navigation** using `<a>` tags  
- **Structure content** clearly (using `<h1>…<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, etc.)
